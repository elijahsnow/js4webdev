    <h1>JS for Web Developers</h1>

    <h1>Advantages for JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>Just-in-time compiling: in modern browsers, most JavaScript is compiled, higly optimized,
        and executed like native code, so runtime performance is close to that of software written
        in C or C++. Of course, there is still the overhead of garbage collection and dynamic
        binding, so it is possible to do certain things faster; however, the difference is generally
        not worth sweating over until you've optimized everything else. With Node.js, JavaScript apps
        are event driven and non-blocking, which generally more than makes up for the code execution
        difference between JavaScript and other less dynamic languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>JS has very rich object-oriented(OO) features. The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) standard used
        in nearly all modern web applications for both communication and data persistence is a subset
        of JavaScript's excellent object-literal notation.</p>

    <p>JavaScript uses a <em>prototypal inheritance</em> model. Instead of classes, you have object
        prototypes. New objects automatically inherit methods and attributes of their parent object
        through the prototype chain. It's possible to modify an object's prototype at any time, making
        JavaScript a very flexible, dynamic language.
    </p>

    <p>Prototypal OO is so much more flexible than classical inheritance that it's possible to mimic
        Java's class-based OO and inheritance models in JavaScript virtually feature for feature, and in
        most cases cases, with less code. The reverse is not true.

        Contrary to popular belief, JavaScript supports features like encapsulation, polymorphism, multiple
        inheritance, and composition.
    </p>
    <h2>First-Class Functions</h2>
    <p>
        In JS, objects are not a tacked-on afterthought. Nearly everything in JavaScript is an object, including
        functions. Because of that feature, functions can be used anywhere you might use a variable, including
        the parameters un function calls. That feature is often used to define anonymous callback functions for
        asynchronous operations, or to create higher order functions (functions that take other functions as
        parameters, return a function, or both). Higher-order functions are used in the functional programming
        style to abstract away commonly repeated coding patterns, such as iteration loops or other instruction
        sets that differ mostly in the variables or data they consume.
    </p>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Inside the browser, everything runs in an event loop. JavaScript coders quickly learn to think in terms
        of event handlers, and as a result, code from experienced JS developers tend to be well organized and
        efiicient. Operations that might block processing in other languages happen concurrently in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click something, you want something to happen instantly. That impatience has led to wonderful
        advancements in UI design. Such funcitonality is powered by Ajax calls that do their thing in the
        background without slowing down the UI.
    </p>
    <h2>Reusability</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript code, by virtue of its ubiquity, is the most portable, reusable code around. What other language
        lets you write the same code that runs natively on both the client and the server? JavaScript can be modular
        and encapsulated, and its common to see scripts written by six different team of developers who have never
        communicated working in harmony on the same page.
    </p>
    <h2>The Net Result</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript developers are at the heart of what may be the single biggest revolution in the history of
        computing: the dawn of the realtime web. Messages pass back and forth across the net, in some cases with
        each keystroke, or every move of the mouse. We're writing applications that put desktop applications UI's
        to shame. Modern JavaScript applications are the most responsive, most socially engaging applications ever
        written-- and if you don't know JavaScript yet, you're missisng the boat. It't time to get on board, before
        you get left behind.
    </p>
    <h1>Anatomy of a Typical Modern JavaScript App</h1>
    <p>While every app is unique, most share some common concerns, such as hosting infrastructure, resource
        management, presentation, and UI behavior. This section covers where these various elements typically live
        in the application and the common mechanisms that allow to communicate.
    </p>
    <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
        Infrastructure can come in many flavors and have lots of different caching mechanisms. Generally,
        it consists of (back to front):
    </p>
           <ul>
            <li>A data store</li>
            <li>A virtual private network (VPN) or firewall (to protect the data store
                from unauthorized access)</li>
            <li>A black box JSON RESTful Web Service Layer</li>
            <li>Various third-party APIs</li>
            <li>An app server/content management system (CMS) to route
                requests and deliver pages to the client.</li>
            <li>A static content deliver network (CDN) for cached
                files (like images, JS, CSS, and cient-side templates</li>
            <li>The client (browser)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Most of these components are self explanatory, but there are some important points that you should be
        aware of concerning the storage and communication of application data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data store is just like it sounds: a place to store your application data. This is commonly a
        relational database management systems (RDBMS) with a Structured Query Language (SQL) API, but the
        popularity of NoSQL solutions is on the rise. In the future, it's likely that many applications will
        use a combination of both.
    </p>
    <h2>JSON: Data Storage and Communication</h2>
    <p>JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) is an open standard developed by Douglas Crockford that specifies
        a subset of the native JavaScript object-literal syntax for use in data representation, communication,
        and storage.
    </p>
    <p>Prior to the JSON specification, most client-server communications were being delivered in much verbose
        XML snippets. JavaScript developers often work with JSON web services and frequently define internal
        data using JSON syntax.
    </p>
    <h2>NoSQL Data Stores</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to the advent of Extensible Markup Language(XML) and JSON data stores, nearly all web services were
        backed by RDBMS. An RDBMS stores discrete datat points in tables and groups data output using table lookups
        in response to SQL queries.
    </p>
    <p>NoSQL data stores, in contrast, store entire records in doucments or documents snippets without resorting to
        table-based structured storage. Document-oriented data stores commonly store data in XML format, while
        object-oriented data stores commonly employ the JSON format. The latter are particularly well suited to
        web application  development, because JSON is the format you use to communicate natively in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of popular JSON-based NoSQL data stores include MongoDB and CouchDB. Despite the recnt popularity
        of NoSQL, it is still common to find modern JavaScript applications backed by MySQL and similar RDBMs.
    </p>
    <h2>RESTful JSON Web Services</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Representational State Transfer</em> is a client-server communication architecture that creates a
        seperation of concerns between data resources and user interfaces (or other data resource cosnumers,
        such as a data analysis tools and aggregators). Services that implement REST are referred to as RESTful.
        The server manages data resources (such as user records). It does not implement the user interface
        (look and feel). Clients are free to implement the UI (or not) in whatever manner or language is desired.
        REST architecture does not address how user interfaces are implemented. It only deals with maintaining
        application state between the client and the server. RESTful web services use HTTP verbs to tell the server
        what action the client intends. The actions supported are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new entry in the resource collection: <strong>HTTP POST</strong></li>
        <li>Retrieve a reosurce representation: <strong>HTTP GET</strong></li>
        <li>Update (replace) the resource: <strong>HTTP PUT</strong> </li>
        <li>Delete a resource: <strong>HTTP DELETE</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This might look familiar if you're familiar with CRUD(create, retrieve, update, delete). Just remember that in
        REST mapping, update really means <em>replace</em>.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The client requests data from the server with an HTTP GET request to the resource <em>uniform resource
            indicator</em> (URI). Each resource on the server has a unique URI.</li>
        <li>The server retrieves the data (typically from a database or cache) and packages it into a convenient
            representation for the client.</li>
        <li>Data is returned in the form of a document. Those documents are commonly text strings containing JSON
            encoded object, but REST is agnostic about how you package your data, it's also common to see XML-based
            RESTful services. Most new services default to JSON formatted data, and many support both XML and JSON.</li>
        <li>The client manipulates the data representation.</li>
        <li>The client makes a call to the same endpoint URI with a PUT, sending back the manipulated data.</li>
        <li>The resource data on the server is replaced by the data in the PUT request.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It's common to be confused about whether to use PUT or POST to change a resource. REST eases that confusion.
        PUT is used if the clinet is capable of generating its own safe IDs. Otherwise, a POST request is always made
        on a collection to create a new resource. In this case, the server generates the ID and returns it to the client.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you might create a new user by hitting /users/ with a POST request, at which point the server will
        generate a unique ID that you can use to access the new resource at /users/userid. The server will return a new
        user representation with its own unique URI. You shouldn't modify any existing resource with POST; you can
        add only children to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use PUT to change the user's display name by hitting /users/userid with the uodated user record. Note that this
        will completely replace the user record, so make sure that the representation you PUT contains everything you
        want it to contain.
